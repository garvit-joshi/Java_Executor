# Java_Executor
A Simple Java Executor For Making .java Files Compiled And Interpret .class Files.<br>
When I Was New To Java I Had Difficulty in opening Command Prompt, Going To Directory And Then Compiling My Newly Made Files.So, I Created This Batch File Program. It Simply Goes To The Directory Where The Program Is Being Executed And Gives A List Of .java files That You Could Compile.<br>
The Program Works With two Python Files ( Filename_class.py and Filename_java.py ) that I Have included in this Repository.<br>

## Pre requisite
1.Java JDK Downloaded And Installed(https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).<br>
2.Python Interpreter Downloaded And Installed(https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br>
3.Python And Java Should Be Installed With Environment Variables.<br>

## Steps:
1.Install Python(https://www.python.org/downloads/), When installing Python Check The Box With "Add Python To PATH".<br>
2.Install Java To Your Machine.Assuming you have installed Java in c:\Program Files\java\jdk directory.<br>
4.Right-click on 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.<br>
5.Click the 'Environment variables' button under the 'Advanced' tab.<br>
6.Now, alter the 'Path' variable so that it also contains the path to the Java executable.Add A new Path to 'c:\Program Files\java\jdk\bin'.<br>
7.Now just Make A Folder In your desired directory where you will keep all your java files And Put These Three Files In The Directory.<br>
8.The Files Are Designed In such a way that they Search For All the .java And .class files and runs them.<br>
