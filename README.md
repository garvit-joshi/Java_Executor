# Java_Executor
A Simple Java Executor For Making .java Files Compiled And Interpret .class Files.
When I Was New To Java I Had Difficulty in opening Command Prompt, Going To Directory And Then Compiling My Newly Made Files.So, I Created This Batch File Program. It Simply Goes To The Directory Where The Program Is Being Executed And Gives A List Of .java files That You Could Compile.
The Program Works With two Python Files ( Filename_class.py and Filename_java.py ) that I Have included in this Repository.

## Pre requisite
1.Java JDK Downloaded And Installed(https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
2.Python Interpreter Downloaded And Installed(https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3.Python And Java Should Be Installed With Environment Variables.

## Steps:
1.Install Python(https://www.python.org/downloads/), When installing Python Check The Box With "Add Python To PATH".
2.Install Java To Your Machine.Assuming you have installed Java in c:\Program Files\java\jdk directory
4.Right-click on 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.
5.Click the 'Environment variables' button under the 'Advanced' tab.
6.Now, alter the 'Path' variable so that it also contains the path to the Java executable.Add A new Path to 'c:\Program Files\java\jdk\bin'.
7.Now just Make A Folder In your desired directory where you will keep all your java files And Put These Three Files In The Directory.
8.The Files Are Designed In such a way that they Search For All the .java And .class files and runs them.
